The "Enders", as dubbed by the humans who know of them, are a humanoid alien race
with extremely advanced technology. "Many decades ago", they invaded Earth, leading
to war between the humans and enders, but the enders were far too powerful for the
humans to win against. When the enders had won, they, for reasons unknown, kept some
number of humans alive, and in some way contained the humans within BitNodes.

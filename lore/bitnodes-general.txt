BitNodes are advanced simulations used to contain humanity by the Enders. It is
unknown how or why they operate, but what is clear is that the World Daemon is
extremely important to the operation of a BitNode. It is possible for the daemon
to be hacked, which results in the entire simulation going offline and the
failure of automatic attempts to reboot the node. The Daemon has a physical
presence, as indicated by the Bladeburners' ability to destroy it via force.
Also, hydroflame (irl) has stated that the glitch in Ishima is the physical
location of the World Daemon in a node. When the player destroys a BitNode, it is
currently unknown what becomes of it, or the people trapped within. However, based
on the way jump3r and Daedalus help the player to destroy it, doing so is somehow
aligned with their goals.

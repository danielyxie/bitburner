## NS.hackAnalyze() method

Get the percent of money stolen with a single thread.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
hackAnalyze(host: string): number;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  host | string | Hostname of the target server. |

<b>Returns:</b>

number

The percentage of money you will steal from the target server with a single hack.

## Remarks

RAM cost: 1 GB

Returns the percentage of the specified serverâ€™s money you will steal with a single hack. This value is returned in percentage form, not decimal (Netscript functions typically return in decimal form, but not this one).

This percentage is influenced by the player's hacking skill.

## Example


```ts
//For example, assume the following returns 0.01:
hackAnalyze("foodnstuff");
//This means that if hack the foodnstuff server, then you will steal 1% of its total money. If you hack using N threads, then you will steal N*0.01 times its total money.
```

Function that is used to try and hack servers to steal money and gain hacking experience. The runtime for this command depends on your hacking level and the target server’s security level when this function is called. In order to hack a server you must first gain root access to that server and also have the required hacking level.

A script can hack a server from anywhere. It does not need to be running on the same server to hack that server. For example, you can create a script that hacks the `foodnstuff` server and run that script on any server in the game.

A successful `hack()` on a server will raise that server’s security level by 0.002.

## Example 1


```ts
// NS1:
var earnedMoney = hack("foodnstuff");
```

## Example 2


```ts
// NS2:
let earnedMoney = await ns.hack("foodnstuff");
```

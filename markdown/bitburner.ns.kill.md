Kills the script on the target server specified by the script’s name and arguments. Remember that scripts are uniquely identified by both their name and arguments. For example, if `foo.script` is run with the argument 1, then this is not the same as `foo.script` run with the argument 2, even though they have the same code.

## Example 1


```ts
//The following example will try to kill a script named foo.script on the foodnstuff server that was ran with no arguments:
kill("foo.script", "foodnstuff");
```

## Example 2


```ts
//The following will try to kill a script named foo.script on the current server that was ran with no arguments:
kill("foo.script", getHostname());
```

## Example 3


```ts
//The following will try to kill a script named foo.script on the current server that was ran with the arguments 1 and “foodnstuff”:
kill("foo.script", getHostname(), 1, "foodnstuff");
```

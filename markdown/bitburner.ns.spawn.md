## NS.spawn() method

Terminates the current script, and then after a delay of about 10 seconds it will execute the newly-specified script. The purpose of this function is to execute a new script without being constrained by the RAM usage of the current one. This function can only be used to run scripts on the local server.

Because this function immediately terminates the script, it does not have a return value.

## NS.disableLog() method

Disables logging for the given function. Logging can be disabled for all functions by passing \`<!-- -->ALL<!-- -->\` as the argument.

Note that this does not completely remove all logging functionality. This only stops a function from logging when the function is successful. If the function fails, it will still log the reason for failure.

Notable functions that cannot have their logs disabled: run, exec, exit.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
disableLog(fn: string): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |

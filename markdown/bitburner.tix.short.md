## TIX.short() method

Attempts to purchase a short position of a stock using a Market Order.

The ability to short a stock is \*\*not\*\* immediately available to the player and must be unlocked later on in the game.

If the player does not have enough money to purchase the specified number of shares, then no shares will be purchased. Remember that every transaction on the stock exchange costs a certain commission fee.

If the purchase is successful, this function will return the stock price at which each share was purchased. Otherwise, it will return 0.

number

Price of the specified darkweb program (if not yet purchased), 0 if it has already been purchased, or -1 if Tor has not been purchased. Throws an error if the specified program/exploit does not exist

This function allows you to check the price of a darkweb exploit/program. You MUST have a TOR router in order to use this function. The price returned by this function is the same price you would see with buy -l from the terminal. Returns the cost of the program if it has not been purchased yet, 0 if it has already been purchased, or -1 if Tor has not been purchased (and thus the program/exploit is not available for purchase).

If the program does not exist, an error is thrown.

## Example 1


```ts
// NS1
getDarkwebProgramCost("brutessh.exe");
```

## Example 2


```ts
// NS2
ns.getDarkwebProgramCost("brutessh.exe");
```

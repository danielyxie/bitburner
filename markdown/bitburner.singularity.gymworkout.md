<b>Signature:</b>

gymWorkout(gymName: string, stat: string): boolean;
```

## Parameters

|  stat | string | The stat you want to train. |

## Remarks

RAM cost: 2 GB

This function will automatically set you to start working out at a gym to train a particular stat. If you are already in the middle of some “working” action (such as working at a company, for a faction, or on a program), then running this function will automatically cancel that action and give you your earnings.

The cost and experience gains for all of these gyms are the same as if you were to manually visit these gyms and train

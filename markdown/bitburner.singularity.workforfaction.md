This function will set you to start working for the specified faction. You must be a member of the faction and that faction must have the specified work type, or else this function will fail. If you are already in the middle of some “working” action (such as working for a company, training at a gym, or creating a program), then running this function will cancel that action.

This function will return true if you successfully start working for the specified faction, and false otherwise.

## Example 1


```js
// NS1
var FACTION_NAME = "CyberSec", WORK_TYPE = "hacking";

var success = singularity.workForFaction(FACTION_NAME, WORK_TYPE);
if (!success) tprint("ERROR: Failed to start work for " + FACTION_NAME + " with work type " + WORK_TYPE);
```

## Example 2


```js
// NS2
const FACTION_NAME = "CyberSec", WORK_TYPE = "hacking";

let success = ns.singularity.workForFaction(FACTION_NAME, WORK_TYPE);
if (!success) ns.tprint(`ERROR: Failed to start work for ${FACTION_NAME} with work type ${WORK_TYPE}.`)
```

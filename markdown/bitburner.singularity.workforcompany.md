This function will set you to start working at your current job at a specified company at which you are employed. If you are already in the middle of some “working” action (such as working for a faction, training at a gym, or creating a program), then running this function will cancel that action.

This function will return true if the player starts working, and false otherwise.

## Example 1


```js
// NS1:
var COMPANY_NAME = "Noodle Bar";

var success = singularity.workForCompany(COMPANY_NAME);
if (!success) tprint("ERROR: Failed to start work at " + COMPANY_NAME + ".");
```

## Example 2


```js
// NS2:
const COMPANY_NAME = "Noodle Bar";

let success = ns.singularity.workForCompany(COMPANY_NAME);
if (!success) ns.tprint(`ERROR: Failed to start work at ${COMPANY_NAME].`);
```

/**
 * This is a component that implements a mathematical formula used commonly throughout the
 * game. This formula is (typically) used to calculate the effect that various statistics
 * have on a game mechanic. It looks something like:
 *
 *  (stat ^ exponential factor) + (stat / linear factor)
 *
 * where the exponential factor is a number between 0 and 1 and the linear factor
 * is typically a relatively larger number.
 *
 * This formula ensures that the effects of the statistic that is being processed
 * has diminishing returns, but never loses its effectiveness as you continue
 * to raise it.
 *
 * There are two implementations of this component. One is simply a function that
 * can be called with the stat and the exponential/linear factors. The other is a
 * class where the exponential and linear factors are defined upon construction.

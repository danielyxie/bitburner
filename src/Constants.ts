    * true/false is a valid value to send to other scripts.
    * workForFaction no longer returns null when trying to work for gang.

    * Tail window is bound to html body.
    * Infiltration reward is tied to your potential stats, not your actual stats
      So you won't lose reward for doing the same thing over and over.
    * intelligence lowers program creation requirements.
    * Terminal parses true as the boolean, not the string.
    * Tail and kill autocomplete using the ns2 autocomplete feature.

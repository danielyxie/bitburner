    LatestUpdate:
    `
    v0.51.3 - 2021-04-16 Y'all broke it on the first day (hydroflame)
    -------

    Passive faction reputation
    * Reworked, from 1 rep / 2 minute. Now is a complicated percentage of the
      reputation you'd gain working for them. It's not op but it feels a bit
      more useful.

    Netscript
    * print/tprint now take any number of arguments.
    * print/tprint will now print object as json.
    * print/tprint now handle passing in an undefined argument properly.

    Casino
    * Cannot bet negative money anymore.
    * Roulette max bet is a bit higher.
    * Coin Flip has a small cooldown.

    Documentation
    * Changed a message that said nsjs only works on Chrome.

    Bugfix
    * hacknet.maxNumNodes now works for both nodes and servers.
    * Fixed a bug where the popup boxes would contain data from previous popup boxes.
    * .js files will also have the export async function boilerplate.
    
    Misc.
    * turned off autocomplete for the terminal text input.
    * Fixed an issue on Windows+Firefox where pressing up on the terminal would
      bring the cursor to the begining of the line. (Issue #836)
    * Hacknet node names is easier to handle for screen readers.
    * Money spent on classes is now tracked independently of work money.

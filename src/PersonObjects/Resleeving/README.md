Implements the Re-sleeving feature, which allows players to purchase a new body
that comes with pre-existing Augmentations and experience. Note that purchasing
a new body causes you to lose all of your old Augmentations and experience

This feature is introduced in BitNode-10, and destroying BitNode-10 allows
the user to use it in other BitNodes (provided that they purchase the required
cortical stack Augmentation)

While they are based on the same concept, this feature is different than the
"Duplicate Sleeve" mechanic (which is referred to as just "Sleeve" in the source code).

"<strong><u>How do Duplicate Sleeves work?</strong></u><br>",
"Duplicate Sleeves are essentially clones. You can use them to perform any work type",
"action, such as working for a company/faction or committing a crime.",
"Having sleeves perform these tasks earns you money, experience, and reputation.<br><br>",
"Sleeves are their own individuals, which means they each have their own",
"experience and stats.<br><br>",
"When a sleeve earns experience, it earns experience for itself, the player's",
"original 'consciousness', as well as all of the player's other sleeves.<br><br>",

"<strong><u>What is Synchronization (Sync)?</strong></u><br>",
"Synchronization is a measure of how aligned your consciousness is with",
"that of your Duplicate Sleeves. It is a numerical value between 1 and 100, and",
"it affects how much experience is earned when the sleeve is performing a task.<br><br>",
"Let N be the sleeve's synchronization. When the sleeve earns experience by performing a",
"task, both the sleeve and the player's original host consciousness earn N%",
"of the amount of experience normally earned by the task. All of the player's",
"other sleeves earn ((N/100)^2 * 100)% of the experience.<br><br>",
"Synchronization can be increased by assigning sleeves to the 'Synchronize' task.<br><br>",

"<strong><u>What is Shock?</u></strong><br>",
"Sleeve shock is a measure of how much trauma the sleeve has due to being placed in a new",
"body. It is a numerical value between 0 and 99, where 99 indicates full shock and 0 indicates",
"no shock. Shock affects the amount of experience earned by the sleeve.<br><br>",
"Sleeve shock slowly decreases over time. You can further increase the rate at which",
"it decreases by assigning sleeves to the 'Shock Recovery' task.<br><br>",

"<strong><u>Why can't I work for this company or faction?</u></strong><br>",
"Only one of your sleeves can work for a given company/faction a time.",
"To clarify further, if you have two sleeves they can work for two different",
"companies, but they cannot both work for the same company.<br><br>",

"<strong><u>Why did my Sleeve stop working?</u></strong><br>",
"Sleeves are subject to the same time restrictions as you. This means that",
"they automatically stop working at a company after 8 hours, and stop working",
"for a faction after 20 hours.<br><br>",

"<strong><u>How do I buy Augmentations for my Sleeves?</u></strong><br>",
"Your Sleeve needs to have a Shock of 0 in order for you to buy Augmentations",
"for it.<br><br>",

"<strong><u>Why can't I buy the X Augmentation for my sleeve?</u></strong><br>",
"Certain Augmentations, like Bladeburner-specific ones and NeuroFlux Governor,",
"are not available for sleeves.<br><br>",

"<strong><u>Do sleeves get reset when installing Augmentations or switching BitNodes?</u></strong><br>",
"Sleeves are reset when switching BitNodes, but not when installing Augmentations.<br><br>",

"<strong><u>What is Memory?</u></strong><br>",
"Sleeve memory dictates what a sleeve's synchronization will be",
"when its reset by switching BitNodes. For example, if a sleeve has a memory of 25,",
"then when you switch BitNodes its synchronization will initially be set to 25, rather than 1.<br><br>",
"Memory can only be increased by purchasing upgrades from The Covenant. It is a",
"persistent stat, meaning it never gets resets back to 1. The maximum possible",
"value for a sleeve's memory is 100.",

    "Your Corporation can have many different divisions, each in a different Industry. There are many different " +

    "Specific information about this is displayed in each of your divisions' UI.<br><br>" +

    "a Product takes time, but a Product typically generates significantly more revenue than any Material. " +
    "Not all industries allow you to create Products. To create a Product, look for a button " +

    "To get your supply chain system started, " +

    "you will immediately start production. The amount of Materials/Products you produce is based on a variety of factors, " +

    "Otherwise, once you feel you are ready, take your Corporation public! Once your Corporation goes public, you can no longer " +

    `Synthoids were first designed and manufactured by ${FactionNames.OmniTekIncorporated} sometime around the middle of the century. ` +
    "Their original purpose was to be used for manual labor and as emergency responders for disasters. As such, they " +
    "were initially programmed only for their specific tasks. Each iteration that followed improved upon the " +
    "intelligence and capabilities of the Synthoids. By the 6th iteration, called MK-VI, the Synthoids were " +
    `so smart and capable enough of making their own decisions that many argued ${FactionNames.OmniTekIncorporated} had created the first ` +
    "sentient AI. These MK-VI Synthoids were produced in mass quantities (estimates up to 50 billion) with the hopes of increasing society's " +
    "productivity and bolstering the global economy. Stemming from humanity's desire for technological advancement, optimism " +
    "and excitement about the future had never been higher.<br><br>" +

    `called Ascendis Totalis hacked into ${FactionNames.OmniTekIncorporated} and uploaded a rogue AI into severeal of their Synthoid manufacturing facilities. ` +
    `This hack went undetected and for months ${FactionNames.OmniTekIncorporated} unknowingly churned out legions of Synthoids embedded with this ` +
    "rogue AI. Then, on December 24th, 2070, Omnica activated dormant protocols in the rogue AI, causing all of the " +
    "infected Synthoids to immediately launch a military campaign to seek and destroy all of humanity.<br><br>" +
    "What ensued was the deadlist conflict in human history. This crisis, now commonly known as the Synthoid Uprising, " +

    "to combat the threat, the MK-VI Synthoids were simply stronger, faster, more intelligent, and more adaptable than humans, " +

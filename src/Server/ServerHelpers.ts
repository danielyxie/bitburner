/**
 * Replacement function for the above function that accounts for the +$1/thread functionality of grow

 * This function can ONLY be used to calculate the threads needed for a given server in its current state,
 * and so wouldn't be appropriate to use for formulas.exe or ns.growthAnalyze (as those are meant to
 * provide theoretical scenarios, or inverse hack respectively). Players COULD use this function with a
 * custom server object with the correct moneyAvailable and moneyMax amounts, combined with a multiplier
 * correctly calculated to bring the server to a new moneyAvailable (ie, passing in moneyAvailable 300 and x2
 * when you want the number of threads required to grow that particular server from 300 to 600), and this
 * function would pass back the correct number of threads. But the key thing is that it doesn't just
 * inverse/undo a hack (since the amount hacked from/to matters, not just the multiplier).
 * The above is also a rather unnecessarily obtuse way of thinking about it for a formulas.exe type of
 * application, so another function with different parameters is provided for that case below this one.
 * Instead this function is meant to hand-off from the old numCycleForGrowth function to the new one
 * where used internally for pro-rating or the like. Where you have applied a grow and want to determine
 * how many threads were needed for THAT SPECIFIC grow case using a multiplier.
 * Ideally, this function, and the original function above will be depreciated to use the methodology
 * and inputs of the new function below this one. Even for internal cases (it's actually easier to do so).

     *** Re-worked the territory 'warfare' mechanic so that player can choose when to engage in it
     *** Gang Members can now be killed during territory 'warfare'
     *** Changed BitNode-2 Multipliers to make hacking slightly less profitable

     * Crimes commited through Singularity function no longer give half money/exp
     * Improved number formatting for Player 'work' actions (including crimes, etc.). These numbers should also adhere to locale settings now (by Kline-)

          You are now attempting to hack the server. Performing a hack takes time and only has a certain percentage

          skill and the server's security level.
          <br />
          <br />
          If your attempt to hack the server is successful, you will steal a certain percentage of the server's total

          <br />
          The amount of money on a server is not limitless. So, if you constantly hack a server and deplete its money,

     * The grow() command requires root access to the target server, but there is no required hacking
     * level to run the command. It also raises the security level of the target server by 0.004.

     * - `"SUCCESS"`: The whole string will be printed in green, similar to the default
     *   theme of the Terminal. Use this prefix to indicate that something is correct.
     *
     * - `"WARN"`: The whole string will be printed in yellow. Use this prefix to
     *   indicate that you or a user of your script should be careful of something.
     *
     * - `"INFO"`: The whole string will be printed in purplish blue. Use this prefix to
     *   remind yourself or a user of your script of something. Think of this prefix as
     *   indicating an FYI (for your information).
     *
     * For custom coloring, use ANSI escape sequences. The examples below use the Unicode
     * escape code `\u001b`. The color coding also works if `\u001b` is replaced with
     * the hexadecimal escape code `\x1b`. The Bash escape code `\e` is not supported.

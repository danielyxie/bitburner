Hi there, hello
===============

It looks like you found a page that doesn't exist!

If you're looking for documentation of the netscript API. It moved  `here <https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.ns.md>`_.

That documentation is autogenerated and therefore is much easier to maintain.

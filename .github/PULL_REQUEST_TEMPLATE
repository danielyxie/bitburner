# PR title

Formatted as such:
SECTION: FIX #xzyw PLAYER DESCRIPTION

SECTION is something like "API", "UI", "MISC", "STANEK", "CORPORATION"
FIX #xyzw is the issue number, if any

# Linked issues

If your pull request is related to a git issue, please link it in the description using #xyz.
If your PR should close the issue when it is merged in, use `fixes #xyz` or `closes #xyz`. It'll automate the process.

# Documentation

- DO NOT CHANGE any markdown/\*.md, these files are autogenerated from NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts and will be overwritten
- DO NOT re-generate the documentation, makes it harder to review.

# Bug fix

- Include how it was tested
- Include screenshot / gif (if possible)

Make sure you run `npm run format` and `npm run lint` before pushing.

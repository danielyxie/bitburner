Formatted as such:
SECTION: FIX #xzyw PLAYER DESCRIPTION

FIX #xyzw is the issue number, if any
PLAYER DESCRIPTION is what you'd tell a non-contributor to convey what is changed.

# Documentation

- DO NOT CHANGE any markdown/\*.md, these files are autogenerated from NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts and will be overwritten
- DO NOT re-generate the documentation, makes it harder to review.

# Bug fix

- Include how it was tested
- Include screenshot / gif (if possible)

Make sure you run `npm run format` and `npm run lint` before pushing.

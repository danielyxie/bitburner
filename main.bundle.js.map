  <Typography>\n          Duplicate Sleeves are essentially clones. You can use them to perform any work type action, such as working\n          for a company/faction or committing a crime. Having sleeves perform these tasks earns you money, experience,\n          and reputation.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeves are their own individuals, which means they each have their own experience and stats.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          When a sleeve earns experience, it earns experience for itself, the player's original 'consciousness', as well\n          as all of the player's other sleeves.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">What is Synchronization (Sync)?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Synchronization is a measure of how aligned your consciousness is with that of your Duplicate Sleeves. It is a\n          numerical value between 1 and 100, and it affects how much experience is earned when the sleeve is performing\n          a task.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Let N be the sleeve's synchronization. When the sleeve earns experience by performing a task, both the sleeve\n          and the player's original host consciousness earn N% of the amount of experience normally earned by the task.\n          All of the player's other sleeves earn ((N/100)^2 * 100)% of the experience.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>Synchronization can be increased by assigning sleeves to the 'Synchronize' task.</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">What is Shock?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeve shock is a measure of how much trauma the sleeve has due to being placed in a new body. It is a\n          numerical value between 0 and 99, where 99 indicates full shock and 0 indicates no shock. Shock affects the\n          amount of experience earned by the sleeve.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeve shock slowly decreases over time.

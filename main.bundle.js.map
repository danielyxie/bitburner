prepare for Steam we will fix some inconsistencies in the Netscript API. Ideally we can also write a\n      save file migration that will automatically convert all breaking changes in your scripts without any\n      player input.\n\n    ** BREAKING (kindof) **\n\n    * All stock market functions are now under the 'stock' namespace, like 'hacknet'\n      However when you load your game with v0.58.0 for the first time it should automatically convert everything.\n\n    ** SF -1 **\n\n    * new SF -1: Reality Alteration\n      \n    ** Gang **\n\n    * Ascension formula now better\n    * Karma requirement now much lower in most nodes\n    * Territory heavily penalizes gains\n    * T.R.P. not available outside BN2.\n\n    ** Netscript **\n\n    * It is no longer possible to send anything but strings or numbers to other scripts. (prevents exploits)\n    * Improve code for some netscript functions (@omuretsu)\n\n    ** Script Editor ** \n\n    * Added Solarized light/dark as theme (@CalvinTrops)\n    * Added theme clo\n    * Fixed sleeve namespace smart autocomplete.\n\n    ** Hacknet Servers **\n\n    * Cores affect grow/weaken like they do on home computer\n\n    ** Infiltration **\n\n    * Slash game modified to be easier.\n\n    ** Misc. **\n\n    * Fix typo in corp (@Saynt_Garmo)\n    * Fixed a bug where corp wouldn't let you buyback shares. (@Saynt_Garmo)\n    * Fixed a bug where sleeves couldn't perform some crimes. (@Saynt_Garmo)\n    * Hospitalization and Eating noodles are now toasts (@Saynt_Garmo)\n    * Fixed some repeated code (@omuretsu)\n    * Fixed Character Overview preventing clicks underneath it even when hidden. (@omuretsu)\n    * Fixed typo in tutorial. (@omuretsu)\n    * Create Programs and Factions invitation badges now dissapear when you open their respective pages.\n    * Add killall script in character overview.\n    * Fixed bug in corp that made last city production be the production for all cities for newly created product.\n    * Fix bug that allowed reputation to transfer to new jobs.\n    * Fixed memory leak with ns2.\n    * nerf

  <Typography>\n          Duplicate Sleeves are essentially clones. You can use them to perform any work type action, such as working\n          for a company/faction or committing a crime. Having sleeves perform these tasks earns you money, experience,\n          and reputation.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeves are their own individuals, which means they each have their own experience and stats.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          When a sleeve earns experience, it earns experience for itself, the player's original 'consciousness', as well\n          as all of the player's other sleeves.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">What is Synchronization (Sync)?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Synchronization is a measure of how aligned your consciousness is with that of your Duplicate Sleeves. It is a\n          numerical value between 1 and 100, and it affects how much experience is earned when the sleeve is performing\n          a task.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Let N be the sleeve's synchronization. When the sleeve earns experience by performing a task, both the sleeve\n          and the player's original host consciousness earn N% of the amount of experience normally earned by the task.\n          All of the player's other sleeves earn ((N/100)^2 * 100)% of the experience.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>Synchronization can be increased by assigning sleeves to the 'Synchronize' task.</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">What is Shock?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeve shock is a measure of how much trauma the sleeve has due to being placed in a new body. It is a\n          numerical value between 0 and 99, where 99 indicates full shock and 0 indicates no shock. Shock affects the\n          amount of experience earned by the sleeve.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeve shock slowly decreases over time.

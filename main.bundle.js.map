What can you do now? You can hack it!\n            <br />\n            <br /> In the year 2077, currency has become digital and decentralized. People and corporations store their\n            money on servers and computers. Using your hacking abilities, you can hack servers to steal money and gain\n            experience. <br />\n            <br />\n            Before you try to hack a server, you should run diagnostics using{\" \"}\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography classes={{ root: classes.textfield }}>{\"[n00dles ~/]> analyze\"}</Typography>\n        </>\n      ),\n      canNext: false,\n    },\n    [iTutorialSteps.TerminalNuke as number]: {\n      content: (\n        <>\n          <Typography>When </Typography>\n          <Typography classes={{ root: classes.textfield }}>{\"[n00dles ~/]> analyze\"}</Typography>\n\n          <Typography>\n            finishes running it will show useful information about hacking the server. <br />\n            <br /> For this server, the required hacking skill is only 1, which means you can hack it right now.\n            However, in order to hack a server you must first gain root access. The NUKE.exe program that we saw earlier\n            on your home computer is a virus that will grant you root access to a machine if there are enough open\n            ports.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography classes={{ root: classes.textfield }}>{\"[n00dles ~/]> analyze\"}</Typography>\n\n          <Typography>\n            {\" \"}\n            shows that there do not need to be any open ports on this machine for the NUKE virus to work, so go ahead\n            and run the virus using{\" \"}\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography classes={{ root: classes.textfield }}>{\"[n00dles ~/]> run NUKE.exe\"}</Typography>\n\n          <Typography></Typography>\n        </>\n      ),\n      canNext: true,\n    },\n    [iTutorialSteps.TerminalManualHack as number]: {\n      content: (\n        <>\n          <Typography>You now have root access!

  <Typography>\n          Duplicate Sleeves are essentially clones. You can use them to perform any work type action, such as working\n          for a company/faction or committing a crime. Having sleeves perform these tasks earns you money, experience,\n          and reputation.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeves are their own individuals, which means they each have their own experience and stats.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          When a sleeve earns experience, it earns experience for itself, the player's original 'consciousness', as well\n          as all of the player's other sleeves.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">What is Synchronization (Sync)?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Synchronization is a measure of how aligned your consciousness is with that of your Duplicate Sleeves. It is a\n          numerical value between 1 and 100, and it affects how much experience is earned when the sleeve is performing\n          a task.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Let N be the sleeve's synchronization. When the sleeve earns experience by performing a task, both the sleeve\n          and the player's original host consciousness earn N% of the amount of experience normally earned by the task.\n          All of the player's other sleeves earn ((N/100)^2 * 100)% of the experience.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>Synchronization can be increased by assigning sleeves to the 'Synchronize' task.</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">What is Shock?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeve shock is a measure of how much trauma the sleeve has due to being placed in a new body. It is a\n          numerical value between 0 and 99, where 99 indicates full shock and 0 indicates no shock. Shock affects the\n          amount of experience earned by the sleeve.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeve shock slowly decreases over time.

(prevents exploits)\n    * Improve code for some netscript functions (@omuretsu)\n\n    ** Script Editor ** \n\n    * Added Solarized light/dark as theme (@CalvinTrops)\n    * Added theme clo\n    * Fixed sleeve namespace smart autocomplete.\n\n    ** Hacknet Servers **\n\n    * Cores affect grow/weaken like they do on home computer\n\n    ** Infiltration **\n\n    * Slash game modified to be easier.\n\n    ** Misc. **\n\n    * Fix typo in corp (@Saynt_Garmo)\n    * Fixed a bug where corp wouldn't let you buyback shares. (@Saynt_Garmo)\n    * Fixed a bug where sleeves couldn't perform some crimes. (@Saynt_Garmo)\n    * Hospitalization and Eating noodles are now toasts (@Saynt_Garmo)\n    * Fixed some repeated code (@omuretsu)\n    * Fixed Character Overview preventing clicks underneath it even when hidden. (@omuretsu)\n    * Fixed typo in tutorial. (@omuretsu)\n    * Create Programs and Factions invitation badges now dissapear when you open their respective pages.\n    * Add killall script in character overview.\n    * Fixed bug in corp that made last city production be the production for all cities for newly created product.\n    * Fix bug that allowed reputation to transfer to new jobs.\n    * Fixed memory leak with ns2.\n    * nerf noodle bar\n`,\n};\n","/**\n * Bitnode multipliers influence the difficulty of different aspects of the game.\n * Each Bitnode has a different theme/strategy to achieving the end goal, so these multipliers will can help drive the\n * player toward the intended strategy.

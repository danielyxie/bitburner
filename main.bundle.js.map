'write' function is now async. This helps when making scripts that write scripts.\n\n    ** Terminal **\n\n    * 'grow' and 'weaken' have been added as terminal command. This should help player transition\n      from commands to scripts. The tutorial also talks about it.\n    * 'cp' command added\n    * Improved performance by rate limiting refresh.\n\n    ** IP vs Hostname **\n\n    * The game now uses hostname as primary key for it's servers (yeah believe it or not IPs were\n      used until then). This has caused some issues with purchased servers (they couldn't be sold).\n      You might need to soft reset for the game to fully convert itself.\n\n    ** Sleeve **\n\n    * Fixed bug where they couldn't train at Volhaven.\n    * No longer consume all bonus time at once, making it look buggy.\n    \n    ** SF9 **\n\n    * Now boosts hacknet production by 8/12/14%\n    \n    ** Hacknet Servers ** \n\n    * production nerfed by 10%\n    * Max money increase gets weaker above 10t max money\n\n    ** Corporation **\n\n    * Warehouse tooltip now also displays the amount of space taken by products.\n    * Changed research box completely to avoid dependency on Treant (Treant is a pita)\n    * All textbox should accept MAX/MP case insensitive.\n    * Fixed export popup not refreshing dropdowns correctly.\n    * Fixed product mku becoming zero\n    * Increased scaling of Wilson to avoid feedback loop.\n    * Can no longer get in debt by buying real estate\n    * Bonus time is consumed faster.\n\n    ** Netscript **\n\n    * isBusy takes bitverse and infiltration into account\n    * hospitalize can't be called when in infiltration.\n    * setToCommitCrime now accepts crime rough name instead of perfect name.\n    * disableLog All now works for bladeburner functions.\n    * Fixed netscript port for ns1.\n    \n    ** Augmentation **\n\n    * Added augmentation to Ti Di Hui that removes penalty for being unfocused.\n    * Neuroflux no longer appears in special factions.\n\n    ** Script Editor ** \n\n    * Ram check is debounced instead of refreshed every second.\n    * Added the vscode extension documentation to the game (it doesn't work well, thought)\n    * Fixed issue where autocomplete list would grow forever\n    * Added semi-monokai as theme.\n    * Fixed issue where modifying filename would mess it up.\n    * Font size can be changed now.\n\n    ** Infiltration ** \n\n    * Fixed issue where game controls would become unfocused.\n\n    ** Misc. **\n\n    * Fixed loader incorrectly assuming some null values are incorrect.\n    * installBackdoor trigger Bitverse sequence\n    * Some improvements to the theme editor\n    * Improved documentation about where to learn javascript.\n    * Added some instructions for contributors.\n    * Fixed typo in corporation sell shares modal (@Saynt_Garmo)\n    * Fixed pagination being black on black in Active Scripts\n    * Create Script tab renamed to Script Editor\n    * Fixed an issue where corp some textbox wouldn't update when changing city.\n    * Fixed an issue where hacknet online time was always 0.\n    * Netscript function prompt fixed.\n    * Fixed miscalculation in growth.\n    * Script with syntax errors will try to be a tad more helpful.\n    * Corporations can no longer bribe bladeburners.\n    * Augmentation Graphene Branchiblade renamed to Brachi, like the rest of them.\n    * All ram is displayed in GB/TB/PB now.\n    * Game now saves when saving a file, this can be turned off.\n    * Several improvement to log window.\n    * Bladeburner current action returns General type instead of the name of the action.\n    * Bladeburner travel and Sleeve travel respect disable ASCII.\n    * Tutorial fits on small screens.\n    * Import is much slower but more consistent now.\n    * Fix intelligence not updating properly.\n    * Added SF -1: Time Compression\n    * ReadTheDoc theme now matches the game.\n    * Logbox should wrap text better\n    * Logbox behavior should feel better.\n    * Fix font for AutoLink.exe\n    * nerf noodle bar\n`,\n};\n","/**\n * Bitnode multipliers influence the difficulty of different aspects of the game.\n * Each Bitnode has a different theme/strategy to achieving the end goal, so these multipliers will can help drive the\n * player toward the intended strategy.

Having sleeves perform these tasks earns you money, experience,\n          and reputation.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeves are their own individuals, which means they each have their own experience and stats.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          When a sleeve earns experience, it earns experience for itself, the player's original 'consciousness', as well\n          as all of the player's other sleeves.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">What is Synchronization (Sync)?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Synchronization is a measure of how aligned your consciousness is with that of your Duplicate Sleeves. It is a\n          numerical value between 1 and 100, and it affects how much experience is earned when the sleeve is performing\n          a task.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Let N be the sleeve's synchronization. When the sleeve earns experience by performing a task, both the sleeve\n          and the player's original host consciousness earn N% of the amount of experience normally earned by the task.\n          All of the player's other sleeves earn ((N/100)^2 * 100)% of the experience.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>Synchronization can be increased by assigning sleeves to the 'Synchronize' task.</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">What is Shock?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeve shock is a measure of how much trauma the sleeve has due to being placed in a new body. It is a\n          numerical value between 0 and 99, where 99 indicates full shock and 0 indicates no shock. Shock affects the\n          amount of experience earned by the sleeve.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeve shock slowly decreases over time. You can further increase the rate at which it decreases by assigning\n          sleeves to the 'Shock Recovery' task.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">Why can't I work for this company or faction?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Only one of your sleeves can work for a given company/faction a time. To clarify further, if you have two\n          sleeves they can work for two different companies, but they cannot both work for the same company.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">Why did my Sleeve stop working?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeves are subject to the same time restrictions as you. This means that they automatically stop working at a\n          company after 8 hours, and stop working for a faction after 20 hours.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">How do I buy Augmentations for my Sleeves?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>Your Sleeve needs to have a Shock of 0 in order for you to buy Augmentations for it.</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">Why can't I buy the X Augmentation for my sleeve?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Certain Augmentations, like Bladeburner-specific ones and NeuroFlux Governor, are not available for sleeves.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">Do sleeves get reset when installing Augmentations or switching BitNodes?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>Sleeves are reset when switching BitNodes, but not when installing Augmentations.</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">What is Memory?</Typography>\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Sleeve memory dictates what a sleeve's synchronization will be when its reset by switching BitNodes. For\n          example, if a sleeve has a memory of 25, then when you switch BitNodes its synchronization will initially be\n          set to 25, rather than 1.\n        </Typography>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Typography>\n          Memory can only be increased by purchasing upgrades from The Covenant.

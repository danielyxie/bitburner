You can use it to program your scripts. Scripts are written in a simplified\n            version of javascript. Copy and paste the following code into the script editor: <br />\n          </Typography>\n\n          <Typography classes={{ root: classes.code }}>\n            <CopyableText\n              value={`while(true) {\n  hack('n00dles');\n}`}\n            />\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography>\n            For anyone with basic programming experience, this code should be straightforward.

(hydroflame & community)\n    -------------------------------------------\n\n    ** BREAKING (kindof) **\n\n    * purchased server cost now scales exponentially past 2^10.\n      I'm going to actually explain this one: Currently the cost of a 2^20GB server is 57b\n      Most players can get that before their first install. In an effort to nerf good players\n      a softcap was added. This softcap is different for every BN.\n\n    ** Script Editor **\n\n    * Added a theme that is close to monokai. Unfortunately a full monokai is impossible because \n      Monaco doesn't have a very good tokenizer.\n    * Opening a file and connecting to a new server will still save the file on the server that the file\n      was opened.\n\n    ** Netscript **\n\n    * New function: alert, which creates a textbox.\n    * New function: toast, creates a notification in the bottom right.\n    * New function: upgradeHomeCores (@Saynt_Garmo)\n    * New function: atExit, allows you to set a callback for when the script closes.\n    * New kindof function: autocomplete, this allows you to tell the game what it should\n      autocomplete on the terminal.\n\n    ** Augmentation **\n\n    * ENM Core (the Augmentation from The Black Hand with the highest rep cost) rep cost\n      reduced from 250 to 175. This will help new players transition from TBH to BitRunners more easily.\n\n    ** Bladeburner **\n\n    * New general action: Incite Violence.

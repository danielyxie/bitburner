This statistic is listed as a percentage, which\n        represents how much of the total territory you control.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Every ~20 seconds, your gang has a chance to 'clash' with other gangs. Your chance to win a clash depends on\n        your gang's power, which is listed in the display below. Your gang's power slowly accumulates over time. The\n        accumulation rate is determined by the stats of all Gang members you have assigned to the 'Territory Warfare'\n        task. Gang members that are not assigned to this task do not contribute to your gang's power. Your gang also\n        loses a small amount of power whenever you lose a clash.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        NOTE: Gang members assigned to 'Territory Warfare' can be killed during clashes. This can happen regardless of\n        whether you win or lose the clash. A gang member being killed results in both respect and power loss for your\n        gang.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The amount of territory you have affects all aspects of your Gang members' production, including money, respect,\n        and wanted level. It is very beneficial to have high territory control.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <input\n        checked={props.gang.territoryWarfareEngaged}\n        id=\"warfare\"\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        style={{ display: \"inline-block\", margin: \"2px\" }}\n        onChange={(event) => (props.gang.territoryWarfareEngaged = event.target.checked)}\n      />\n      <label htmlFor=\"warfare\" className=\"tooltip noselect\" style={{ color: \"white\", display: \"inline-block\" }}>\n        Engage in Territory Warfare\n        <span className=\"tooltiptext\" style={{ display: \"inline-block\" }}>\n          Engaging in Territory Warfare sets your clash chance to 100%.

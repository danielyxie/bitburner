(hydroflame & community)\n    -------------------------------------------\n\n    ** BREAKING (kindof) **\n\n    * purchased server cost now scales exponentially past 2^10.\n      I'm going to actually explain this one: Currently the cost of a 2^20GB server is 57b\n      Most players can get that before their first install. In an effort to nerf good players\n      a softcap was added. This softcap is different for every BN.\n\n    ** Script Editor **\n\n    * Added a theme that is close to monokai. Unfortunately a full monokai is impossible because \n      Monaco doesn't have a very good tokenizer.\n    * Opening a file and connecting to a new server will still save the file on the server that the file\n      was opened.\n\n    ** Netscript **\n\n    * New function: alert, which creates a textbox.\n    * New function: toast, creates a notification in the bottom right.\n    * New function: upgradeHomeCores (@Saynt_Garmo)\n    * New function: atExit, allows you to set a callback for when the script closes.\n    * New kindof function: autocomplete, this allows you to tell the game what it should\n      autocomplete on the terminal.\n\n    ** Augmentation **\n\n    * ENM Core (the Augmentation from The Black Hand with the highest rep cost) rep cost\n      reduced from 250 to 175. This will help new players transition from TBH to BitRunners more easily.\n\n    ** Bladeburner **\n\n    * New general action: Incite Violence. This action adds other action counts but increases chaos.\n\n    ** Misc. **\n\n    * Current bladeburner action is shown on the character overview.\n    * Fix blackop being #000 on #000.\n    * The last clicked Tail Box goes in front of the others.\n    * Fixed an issue where some values were loaded as 0 when they should be null.\n    * Implemented toasts.\n    * .msg are no longer saved in the text file.\n    * Tail boxes no longer display all the args, they use \"...\" after 30 characters.\n    * Fixed cancelation penalty bonus not being properly applied after the IP <-> hostname switch.\n    * Fixed an exploit where you could send non-strings or numbers to other scripts.\n    * Fixed issue when trying to work for a faction with a work type that doesn't exist while\n      already working for that faction.\n    * Fixed not being able to work for the CIA. (Don't ask)\n    * nerf noodle bar\n`,\n};\n","/**\n * Bitnode multipliers influence the difficulty of different aspects of the game.\n * Each Bitnode has a different theme/strategy to achieving the end goal, so these multipliers will can help drive the\n * player toward the intended strategy.

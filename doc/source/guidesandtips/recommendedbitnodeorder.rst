What BitNode should I do?
=========================

.. warning:: This page contains spoilers regarding the game's story/plot-line.

After destroying their first :ref:`BitNode <gameplay_bitnodes>`, many players
wonder which BitNode they should tackle next. This guide hopefully helps answer
that question.

Overview of each BitNode
------------------------

BitNode-1: Source Genesis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    The first BitNode created by the Enders to imprison the minds of humans. It became
    the prototype and testing-grounds for all of the BitNodes that followed.

    This is the first BitNode that you play through. It has no special
    modifications or mechanics.

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    This Source-File lets the player start with 32GB of RAM on his/her home computer when
    entering a new BitNode, and also increases all of the player's multipliers by:

    * Level 1: 16%
    * Level 2: 24%
    * Level 3: 28%

Difficulty
    The easiest BitNode

BitNode-2: Rise of the Underworld
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    From the shadows, they rose.

    Organized crime groups quickly filled the void of power left behind from the collapse of
    Western government in the 2050s. As society and civlization broke down, people quickly
    succumbed to the innate human impulse of evil and savagery. The organized crime
    factions quickly rose to the top of the modern world.

    In this BitNode:

    * Your hacking level is reduced by 20%
    * The growth rate and maximum amount of money available on servers are significantly decreased
    * The amount of money gained from crimes and Infiltration is tripled
    * Certain Factions (Slum Snakes, Tetrads, The Syndicate, The Dark Army, Speakers for the Dead,
      NiteSec, The Black Hand) give the player the ability to form and manage their own gangs. These gangs
      will earn the player money and reputation with the corresponding Faction
    * Every Augmentation* in the game will be available through the Factions listed above
    * For every Faction NOT listed above, reputation gains are halved
    * You will no longer gain passive reputation with Factions

    (* except Neuroflux Governor, The Red Pill and augments of secret factions)

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    This Source-File allows you to form gangs in other BitNodes once your karma decreases to a certain value.
    It also increases the player's crime success rate, crime money, and charisma multipliers by:

    * Level 1: 24%
    * Level 2: 36%
    * Level 3: 42%

Difficulty
    Fairly easy, as hacking is still very profitable and the costs of various purchases/upgrades
    is not increased. The gang mechanic may seem strange as its very different from anything
    else, but it can be very powerful once you get the hang of it.

BitNode-3: Corporatocracy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    Our greatest illusion is that a healthy society can revolve around a
    single-minded pursuit of wealth.

    Sometime in the early 21st century economic and political globalization turned
    the world into a corporatocracy, and it never looked back. Now, the privileged
    elite will happily bankrupt their own countrymen, decimate their own community,
    and evict their neighbors from houses in their desperate bid to increase their wealth.
    
    In this BitNode you can create and manage your own corporation. Running a successful corporation
    has the potential of generating massive profits. All other forms of income are reduced by 75%. Furthermore:

    * The price and reputation cost of all Augmentations is tripled
    * The starting and maximum amount of money on servers is reduced by 80%
    * Server growth rate is reduced by 80%
    * You now only need 75 favour with a faction in order to donate to it, rather than 150

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    This Source-File lets you create corporations on other BitNodes (although
    some BitNodes will disable this mechanic) and level 3 permanently unlocks the full API. This Source-File also increases your
    charisma and company salary multipliers by:

    * Level 1: 8%
    * Level 2: 12%
    * Level 3: 14%

Difficulty
    Somewhat-steep learning curve as you learn how to use and manage Corporations. Afterwards,
    however, the BitNode is easy as Corporations can be very profitable.

BitNode-4: The Singularity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    The Singularity has arrived. The human race is gone, replaced by artificially superintelligent
    beings that are more machine than man.

    In this BitNode, progressing is significantly harder:

    * Experience gain rates for all stats are reduced.
    * Most methods of earning money will now give significantly less.

    In this BitNode you will gain access to a new set of Netscript Functions known as Singularity Functions.
    These functions allow you to control most aspects of the game through scripts, including
    working for factions/companies, purchasing/installing Augmentations, and creating programs.

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    This Source-File lets you access and use the Singularity Functions in other BitNodes.
    Each level of this Source-File will reduce RAM costs:

    * Level 1: 16x
    * Level 2: 6x
    * Level 3: 1x

Difficulty:
    Depending on what Source-Files you have unlocked before attempting this BitNode,
    it can range from easy to moderate.

BitNode-5: Artificial Intelligence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    They said it couldn't be done. They said the human brain,
    along with its consciousness and intelligence, couldn't be replicated. They said the complexity
    of the brain results from unpredictable, nonlinear interactions that couldn't be modeled
    by 1's and 0's. They were wrong.

    In this BitNode:

    * The base security level of servers is doubled
    * The starting money on servers is halved, but the maximum money is doubled
    * Most methods of earning money now give significantly less
    * Infiltration gives 50% more reputation and money
    * Corporations have 50% lower valuations and are therefore less profitable
    * Augmentation price is doubled
    * Hacking experience gain rates are reduced

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    This Source-File grants you a special new stat called Intelligence.

    Intelligence is unique because it is permanent and persistent (it never gets reset back to 1). However
    gaining Intelligence experience is much slower than other stats, and it is also hidden (you won't know
    when you gain experience and how much). Higher Intelligence levels will boost your production for many actions
    in the game.

    In addition, this Source-File will unlock the :js:func:`getBitNodeMultipliers()` Netscript function,
    and will also raise all of your hacking-related multipliers by:

    * Level 1: 8%
    * Level 2: 12%
    * Level 3: 14%

Difficulty
    Depending on what Source-Files you have unlocked before attempting this BitNode, it
    can range from easy to moderate.

BitNode-6: Bladeburners
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    In the middle of the 21st century, OmniTek Incorporated began designing and manufacturing advanced synthetic
    androids, or Synthoids for short. They achieved a major technological breakthrough in the sixth generation
    of their Synthoid design, called MK-VI, by developing a hyperintelligent AI. Many argue that this was
    the first sentient AI ever created. This resulted in Synthoid models that were stronger, faster, and more intelligent
    than the humans that had created them.

    In this BitNode you will be able to access the Bladeburner Division at the NSA, which provides
    a new mechanic for progression. Furthermore:

    * Hacking and Hacknet Nodes will be less profitable
    * Your hacking level is reduced by 65%
    * Hacking experience gain is reduced by 75%
    * Corporations have 80% lower valuations and are therefore less profitable
    * Working for companies is 50% less profitable
    * Crimes and Infiltration are 25% less profitable

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    This Source-File allows you to access the NSA's Bladeburner Division in other
    BitNodes. In addition, this Source-File will raise both the level and experience
    gain rate of all your combat stats by:

    * Level 1: 8%
    * Level 2: 12%
    * Level 3: 14%

Difficulty
    Initially difficult due to the fact that hacking is no longer profitable and you have
    to learn a new mechanic. After you get the hang of the Bladeburner mechanic, however,
    it becomes moderately easy.

BitNode-7: Bladeburners 2079
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    In the middle of the 21st century, you were doing cutting-edge work at OmniTek Incorporated
    as part of the AI design team for advanced synthetic androids, or Synthoids for short. You helped
    achieve a major technological breakthrough in the sixth generation of the company's Synthoid
    design, called MK-VI, by developing a hyperintelligent AI. Many argue that this was the first
    sentient AI ever created. This resulted in Synthoid models that were stronger, faster,
    and more intelligent than the humans that had created them.

    In this BitNode you will be able to access the Bladeburner API, which allows you to access
    Bladeburner functionality through Netscript. Furthermore:

    * The rank you gain from Bladeburner contracts/operations is reduced by 40%
    * Bladeburner skills cost twice as many skill points
    * Augmentations are 3x more expensive
    * Hacking and Hacknet Nodes will be significantly less profitable
    * Your hacking level is reduced by 65%
    * Hacking experience gain is reduced by 75%
    * Corporations have 80% lower valuations and are therefore less profitable
    * Working for companies is 50% less profitable
    * Crimes and Infiltration are 25% less profitable

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    This Source-File allows you to access the Bladeburner Netscript API in other
    BitNodes. In addition, this Source-File will increase all of your Bladeburner multipliers by:

    * Level 1: 8%
    * Level 2: 12%
    * Level 3: 14%

Difficulty
    Slightly more difficult than BitNode-6. However, you will be able to automate more
    aspects of the Bladeburner feature, which means it will be more passive.

BitNode-8: Ghost of Wall Street
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    You are trying to make a name for yourself as an up-and-coming hedge fund manager on Wall Street.

    In this BitNode:

    * You start with $250 million
    * The only way to earn money is by trading on the stock market
    * You start with a WSE membership and access to the TIX API
    * You are able to short stocks and place different types of orders (limit/stop)
    * You can immediately donate to factions to gain reputation

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    This Source-File grants the following benefits:

    * Level 1: Permanent access to WSE and TIX API
    * Level 2: Ability to short stocks in other BitNodes
    * Level 3: Ability to use limit/stop orders in other BitNodes

    This Source-File also increases your hacking growth multipliers by:

    * Level 1: 12%
    * Level 2: 18%
    * Level 3: 21%

Difficulty
    Very difficult until you unlock the Four Sigma (4S) Market Data API. After you
    unlock the API however, it becomes moderately easy.

BitNode-9: Hacktocracy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    When Fulcrum Technologies released their open-source Linux distro Chapeau, it quickly
    became the OS of choice for the underground hacking community. Chapeau became especially
    notorious for  powering the Hacknet, a global, decentralized network used for nefarious
    purposes. Fulcrum quickly abandoned the project and dissociated themselves from it.

    This BitNode unlocks the Hacknet Server, an upgraded version of the Hacknet Node. Hacknet Servers generate
    hashes, which can be spent on a variety of different upgrades.

    In this BitNode:

    * Your stats are significantly decreased
    * You cannot purchase additional servers
    * Hacking is significantly less profitable

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    This Source-File grants the following benefits:

    * Level 1: Permanently unlocks the Hacknet Server in other BitNodes
    * Level 2: You start with 128GB of RAM on your home computer when entering a new BitNode
    * Level 3: Grants a highly-upgraded Hacknet Server when entering a new BitNode

    (Note that the Level 3 effect of this Source-File only applies when entering a new BitNode, NOT
    when installing Augmentations.)

    This Source-File also increases your hacknet multipliers by:

    * Level 1: 8%
    * Level 2: 12%
    * Level 3: 14%

Difficulty
    Hard

BitNode-10: Digital Carbon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    In 2084, VitaLife unveiled to the world the Persona Core, a technology that allowed people
    to digitize their consciousness. Their consciousness could then be transferred into Synthoids
    or other bodies by trasmitting the digitized data. Human bodies became nothing more than 'sleeves'
    for the human consciousness. Mankind had finally achieved immortality - at least for those
    that could afford it.

    This BitNode unlocks Sleeve and grafting technologies. Sleeve technology allows you to:

    1. Re-sleeve: Purchase and transfer your consciousness into a new body
    2. Duplicate Sleeves: Duplicate your consciousness into Synthoids, allowing you to perform different tasks synchronously

    Grafting technology allows you to graft Augmentations, which is an alternative way of installing Augmentations.

    In this BitNode:

    * Your stats are significantly decreased
    * All methods of gaining money are half as profitable (except Stock Market)
    * Purchased servers are more expensive, have less max RAM, and a lower maximum limit
    * Augmentations are 5x as expensive and require twice as much reputation

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    This Source-File unlocks Sleeve and grafting technologies in other BitNodes.
    Each level of this Source-File also grants you a Duplicate Sleeve.

Difficulty
    Hard

BitNode-11: The Big Crash
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    The 2050s was defined by the massive amounts of violent civil unrest and anarchic rebellion that rose all around the world. It was this period
    of disorder that eventually lead to the governmental reformation of many global superpowers, most notably
    the USA and China. But just as the world was slowly beginning to recover from these dark times, financial catastrophe hit.

    In many countries, the high cost of trying to deal with the civil disorder bankrupted the governments. In all of this chaos and confusion, hackers
    were able to steal billions of dollars from the world's largest electronic banks, prompting an international banking crisis as
    governments were unable to bail out insolvent banks. Now, the world is slowly crumbling in the middle of the biggest economic crisis of all time.

    In this BitNode:

    * Your hacking stat and experience gain are reduced
    * The starting and maximum amount of money available on servers are reduced by 90%
    * The growth rate of servers is significantly reduced
    * Weakening a server is twice as effective
    * Company wages are decreased by 50%
    * Corporation valuations are 90% lower and are therefore significantly less profitable
    * Hacknet Node production is significantly decreased
    * Crime and Infiltration are more lucrative
    * Augmentations are twice as expensive

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 11, or if you already have this Source-File it will
    upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File makes it so that company favor increases BOTH
    the player's salary and reputation gain rate at that company by 1% per favor (rather than just the reputation gain).
    This Source-File also increases the player's company salary and reputation gain multipliers by:

    * Level 1: 32%
    * Level 2: 48%
    * Level 3: 56%

    This Source-File reduces the price increase for every aug bought by:

    * Level 1: 4%
    * Level 2: 6%
    * Level 3: 7%

Difficulty
    Hard

BitNode-12: The Recursion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    Every time this BitNode is destroyed, it becomes slightly harder.

Source-File
    :Max Level: Infinity

    Each level of Source-File 12 will let you start with Neuroflux Governor
    equal to the level of this Source-File.

    This BitNode is meant to be done passively or when waiting for new content.

Difficulty
    Initially very easy, but then it (obviously) becomes harder as you continue to do it.

BitNode-13: They're lunatics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description
    With the invention of Augmentations in the 2040s a religious group known as the Church of the Machine God has rallied far more support than anyone would have hoped.

    Their leader, Allison "Mother" Stanek is said to have created her own Augmentation whose power goes beyond any other. Find her in Chongqing and gain her trust.

    In this BitNode:

    * Your hacking stat is reduced by 75% and exp by 90%
    * Your combat stats are reduced by 30%
    * Class and gym exp gains halved
    * The starting and maximum amount of money available on servers is decreased
    * The starting security on servers is significantly increased
    * Hacking money is decreased by 80%
    * Company wages are decreased by 60% and exp gains by 50%
    * Hacknet Node production is decreased by 60%
    * Crime money is decreased by 60% and exp gains by 50%
    * Stockmarket data costs are increased 10-fold
    * Corporation valuations are 99.9% lower and are therefore extremely less profitable
    * The rank you gain from Bladeburner contracts/operations is reduced by 55%
    * Bladeburner skills cost twice as many skill points
    * Coding contracts rewards reduced by 60%
    * Gangs gain are reduced significantly and offer low amount of Augmentations
    * Size of Stanek's Gift is increased by 1 size

Source-File
    :Max Level: 3

    Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 13, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. 
    This Source-File lets the Church of the Machine God appear in other BitNodes.

    Each level of this Source-File increases the size of Stanek's Gift.

    * Level 1: 5x5
    * Level 2: 6x6
    * Level 3: 7x7

Difficulty
    Hard

Recommended BitNodes
--------------------
As a player, you are not forced to tackle the BitNodes in any particular order. You are
free to choose whichever ones you want. The "best" order can vary between players,
depending on what you like to do any what kind of player you are. In general, here
are the recommended BitNodes for different things:

For fast progression
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. note:: These paths do not recommend the absolute fastest path, since speed of progression is 
    highly dependant on playing style. Path 1 is the recommended path according to the discord community.

Path 1 (new):

1. (Optional) Repeat **BitNode-1: Source Genesis** until you max out its Source-File. Its Source-File
   is extremely powerful, as it raises all multipliers by a significant amount. This also a let's you 
   get used to augments and other features resetting.

2. Do **BitNode-3: Corporatocracy** once to unlock the Corporation mechanic. This mechanic
   has highest profit potential in the game.

3. Do **BitNode-10: Digital Carbon** once to unlock sleeves and grafting. Sleeves are useful in all nodes
   and grafting can be useful in future BitNodes (especially 8). It's recommended to buy all sleeves and 
   their memory during the first run.

    The ordering of the next three is dependant on playing style and wants/needs.

4. Do **BitNode-5: Artificial Intelligence** once or twice. The intelligence stat it unlocks
   will gradually build up as you continue to play the game, and will be helpful
   in the future. The Source-File also provides hacking multipliers, which are
   strong because hacking is typically one of the best ways of earning money.

5. Do **BitNode-4: The Singularity**. Its Source-File does not directly make you
   more powerful in any way, but it does unlock the `Singularity API <https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.singularity.md>`_ which
   let you automate significantly more aspects of the game. Consider repeating until Level 3, 
   since each level decreases the RAM cost of Singularity functions.

6. Do **BitNode-2: Rise of the Underworld** once to unlock the gang mechanic. This mechanic
   has high profit potential and offers large amounts of Augmentations in a single faction.
   Having sleeves (Source-File 10) greatly reduces the time it takes to get access to gangs 
   outside this BitNode.

7. Do **BitNode-9: Hacktocracy** to unlock the Hacknet Server mechanic. You can
   consider repeating it as well, as its Level 2 and 3 effects are pretty helpful as well.

Path 2 (old):

1. Repeat **BitNode-1: Source Genesis** until you max out its Source-File. Its Source-File
   is extremely powerful, as it raises all multipliers by a significant amount.

2. Do **BitNode-5: Artificial Intelligence** once or twice. The intelligence stat it unlocks
   will gradually build up as you continue to play the game, and will be helpful
   in the future. The Source-File also provides hacking multipliers, which are
   strong because hacking is typically one of the best ways of earning money.

3. (Optional) Consider doing **BitNode-4: The Singularity**. Its Source-File does not directly make you
   more powerful in any way, but it does unlock the `Singularity API <https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.singularity.md>`_ which
   let you automate significantly more aspects of the game.

4. Do **BitNode-3: Corporatocracy** once to unlock the Corporation mechanic. This mechanic
   has high profit potential.

5. Do **BitNode-6: Bladeburners** once to unlock the Bladeburners mechanic. The Bladeburner
   mechanic is useful for some of the future BitNodes (such as 9 and 10).

6. Do **BitNode-9: Hacktocracy** to unlock the Hacknet Server mechanic. You can
   consider repeating it as well, as its Level 2 and 3 effects are pretty helpful as well.

.. todo:: To be continued as more BitNodes get added

For the strongest Source-Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note that the strongest Source-Files are typically rewarded by the hardest BitNodes.

The strongest Source-File is that from **BitNode-1: Source Genesis**, as it raises
all multipliers by a significant amount.

Similarly, the Source-File from **BitNode-12: The Recursion** is also very strong
because it raises all multipliers. Each level of Source-File 12 is fairly weak,
but its effectiveness gets better over time since the effects of Source-Files and
Augmentations are multiplicative with each other.

The Source-File from **BitNode-9: Hacktocracy** is good because it unlocks the Hacknet
Server mechanic. The Hacknet Server mechanic causes Hacknet Nodes to produce a new
currency called *hashes*, rather than money. *Hashes* can be spent on powerful upgrades
that benefit your hacking, Corporation, Bladeburner, etc.

The Duplicate Sleeves granted by the Source-File from **BitNode-10: Digital Carbon**
are strong, but only after you have several of them and have spent some time/money upgrading
them.

For more scripting/hacking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**BitNode-4: The Singularity** unlocks the `Singularity API <https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.singularity.md>`_, which
can be used to automate many different aspects of the game, including working for factions/companies,
purchasing & installing Augmentations, and creating programs

**BitNode-6** and **BitNode-7** unlock Bladeburner and its corresponding
`Netscript API <https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.bladeburner.md>`_. This allows you to automate an entire
new mechanic.

**BitNode-2: Rise of the Underworld** also unlocks a new mechanic and Netscript API for automating
it (the Gang mechanic). However, it is not as interesting as Bladeburner (in my opinion)

**BitNode-9: Hacktocracy** unlocks the Hacknet Server mechanic and several new
functions in the :ref:`Hacknet Node API <netscript_hacknetnodeapi>` for using it.

For new mechanics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**BitNode-2: Rise of the Underworld** unlocks a new mechanic in which you can
manage a gang. Gangs earn you money and can be very profitable once they get large
and powerful. The biggest benefit of gangs, however, is that they make all
Augmentations available to you through their corresponding faction.

**BitNode-3: Corporatocracy** unlocks a new mechanic in which you can manage a
corporation. You can earn money through Corporations by selling your stocks, or by
configuring your corporation to pay dividends to shareholders. If your Corporation
gets big enough, it can also bribe factions in exchange for faction reputation.

**BitNode-6: Bladeburners** unlocks a new mechanic that centers around combat rather
than hacking. The main benefit of the Bladeburner mechanic is that it offers a new
method of destroying a BitNode.

**BitNode-9: Hacktocracy** unlocks the Hacknet Server, which is an upgraded version of a
Hacknet Node. The Hacknet Server generates a computational unit called a *hash*. *Hashes*
can be spent on a variety of different upgrades that can benefit your hacking,
Corporation, Bladeburner progress, and more. It transforms the Hacknet Node from a
simple money-generator to a more interesting mechanic.

**BitNode-10: Digital Carbon** unlocks two new mechanics: Re-Sleeving and
Duplicate Sleeves.

**BitNode-13: They're lunatics** unlocks Stanek's Gift. This gift can improve skills, 
hacknet production and costs, working and crime gains as well hacking power and speed.

For a Challenge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In general, the higher BitNodes are more difficult than the lower ones.
**BitNode-12: The Recursion** is an obvious exception as it gets progressively harder.

**BitNode-8: Ghost of Wall Street** provides a unique challenge as the only method
of earning money in that BitNode is through trading at the stock market.

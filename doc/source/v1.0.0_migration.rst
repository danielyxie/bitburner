v1.0.0 Migration Guide
======================

In v1.0.0 a few API have been broken.

migrated: 

* bladeburner.getActionTime will return milliseconds instead of seconds.
* getHackTime will return milliseconds instead of seconds.
* getGrowTime will return milliseconds instead of seconds.
* getWeakenTime will return milliseconds instead of seconds.
* hackAnalyzePercent renamed to hackAnalyze
* hackAnalyzePercent will return decimal instead of percentage
* hackChance (not formulas.basic.hackChance) renamed to hackAnalyzeChance

not migrated (require manual changes sometimes):

* getPurchasedServers won't let you query for ips instead of hostnames.
* getStats is deprecated in favor getPlayer
* getCharacterInformation is deprecated in favor getPlayer
* getServerRam deprecated in favor of getServerMaxRam and getServerUsedRam
* getServerBaseSecurityLevel will be deprecated in favor of nothing, it's not really used.
* sleep can no longer be called simultenaously, a new function called asleep will let you.
* write returns promise (needs to be await ed).
* scp returns a promise (needs to be await ed).
* free port, write, read
* write, read does not support port anymore, writePort and readPort does.

Upon loading v1.0.0 the game will apply some rules to change everything.
The game never changes a file before making a backup called `BACKUP_filename.ext`, then,
in the script it will change whatever it thinks it should change.
But will prefix the modified line with the original line.

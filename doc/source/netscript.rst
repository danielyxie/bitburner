Netscript
=========
Netscript is the programming language used in the world of Bitburner.

When you write scripts in Bitburner, they are written in the Netscript language.
Netscript is simply a subset of `JavaScript <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript>`_.
This means that Netscript's syntax is
identical to that of JavaScript, but it does not implement some of the features
that JavaScript has.

If you have any requests or suggestions to improve the Netscript language, feel free
to reach out to the developer!

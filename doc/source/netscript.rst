Netscript Documentation
=======================
Netscript is the programming language used in the world of Bitburner.

When you write scripts in Bitburner, they are written in the Netscript language.
Netscript is simply a tiny subset of Javascript. This means that Netscript's
syntax is almost idental to Javascript's, but it does not implement many of the
features that Javascript has.

If you have any requests or suggestions to improve the Netscript language, feel free
to reach out to the developer!

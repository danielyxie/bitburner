============
Intelligence is a :ref:`stat <gameplay_stats>` that is unlocked by having

Intelligence is unique because it is permanent and persistent. It never gets reset
back to 1. However, gaining Intelligence experience is extremely slow. It is a stat

* Hacking
* Infiltration
* Crime success rate
* Bladeburner
* Reputation gain for companies & factions
* Augmentation grafting speed

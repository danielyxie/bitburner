Intelligence
============
Intelligence is a :ref:`stat <gameplay_stats>` that is unlocked by having
:ref:`Source-File 5 <gameplay_sourcefiles>` (i.e. Destroying BitNode-5).

Intelligence is unique because it is permanent and persistent. It never gets reset
back to 1. However, gaining Intelligence experience is extremely slow. It is a stat
that gradually builds up as you continue to play the game.

Intelligence will boost your production for many actions in the game, including:

* Hacking
* Infiltration
* Crime success rate
* Bladeburner
* Reputation gain for companies & factions
* Augmentation crafting speed

Source-Files
============
Source-Files are a type of persistent upgrade that are more powerful than Augmentations.
Source-Files are received by destroying a BitNode. There are many different BitNodes
in the game and each BitNode will grant a different Source-File when it is destroyed.

A Source-File can be upgraded by destroying its corresponding BitNode a second or
third time (AKA playing through that BitNode again). It can be upgraded to a maximum
of level 3.

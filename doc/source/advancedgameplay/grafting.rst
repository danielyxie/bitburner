Grafting
========
Grafting is an experimental process through which you can obtain the benefits of
Augmentations, without needing to reboot your body.

Grafting can be done at VitaLife in New Tokyo, where you'll find a shady researcher with
questionable connections. From there, you can spend a sum of money to begin grafting
Augmentations. This will take some time. When done, the Augmentation will be applied to
your character without needing to install.

Be warned, some who have tested grafting have reported an unidentified malware. Dubbed
"Entropy", this virus seems to grow in potency as more Augmentations are grafted,
causing unpredictable affects to the victim.

Note that when crafting an Augmentation, cancelling will **not** save your progress,
and the money spent will **not** be returned.

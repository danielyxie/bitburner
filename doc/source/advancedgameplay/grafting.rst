Grafting
========
Grafting is an experimental process through which you can obtain the benefits of
Augmentations, without needing to reboot your body.

In order to graft, you must first purchase a blueprint for and craft the Augmentation.
This can be done at VitaLife in New Tokyo, where you'll find a shady researcher with
questionable connections. Once you purchase a blueprint, you will start crafting the
Augmentation, and it will be grafted to your body once complete.

Be warned, some who have tested grafting have reported an unidentified malware. Dubbed
"Entropy", this virus seems to grow in potency as more Augmentations are grafted,
causing unpredictable affects to the victim.

Note that when crafting an Augmentation, cancelling will **not** save your progress,
and the money spent will **not** be returned.

Official Script Repository
--------------------------
There are plans to create an official repository of Bitburner scripts. As of right now,
this is not a priority and has not been started. However, if you'd like
to contribute scripts now, you can find the repository
`here <https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-scripts>`_ and submit pull requests.

Visual Studio Code Extension
----------------------------
One user created a Bitburner extension for the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor.

This extension includes several features such as:

* Dynamic RAM calculation
* RAM Usage breakdown
* Typescript definition files with jsdoc comments
* Netscript syntax highlighting

You can find more information and download links
`on this reddit post <https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitburner/comments/bh48y2/visual_studio_code_ram_calculator_extra/>`_.

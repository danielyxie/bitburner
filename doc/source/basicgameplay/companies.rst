Companies
=========
When exploring the :ref:`world <gameplay_world>`, you can visit various companies. At
these companies, you can apply for jobs.

Working a job lets you earn money, experience, and reputation with that company.

While working for a company, you can click "Do something else simultaneously" to be able 
to do things while you continue to work in the background. There is a 20% penalty to the 
related gains. Clicking the "Focus" button under the overview will return you to the 
current work.   

Reputation is required to apply for a promotion. This reputation is not counted towards
your career until the shift ends, either due to the time spent or clicking the 
"Stop Working" button. For most jobs there is a penalty of 50% of the reputation gained
if you stop your shift early.

Infiltration
============
Infiltration is a gameplay mechanic that allows you to infiltrate a
company's facility to try and steal the company's classified secrets.
These secrets can be sold for money or for reputation with a faction.

Overview
^^^^^^^^
Many companies have facilities that you can attempt to infiltrate.
By infiltrating, you can steal classified company secrets and then sell
these for money or for faction reputation. To try and infiltrate a company,
visit a company through the 'World' menu. There will be an option that
says 'Infiltrate Company'.

When infiltrating a company you will be presented with short active challenges.
None of the challenges use the mouse.

The difficulty at the top lowers with better combat stats and charisma. It is not recommended
to attempt infiltrations above mid-normal.

The "maximum level" is the number of challenges you will need to pass to receive
the infiltration reward.

Every time you fail an infiltration challenge, you will take damage based on the
difficulty of the infiltration. If you are reduced to 0 hp or below, the
infiltration will immediately end.

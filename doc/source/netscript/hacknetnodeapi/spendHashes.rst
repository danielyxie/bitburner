.. warning:: This page contains spoilers for the game

.. js:function:: spendHashes(upgName, upgTarget)

    :RAM cost: 0 GB

    :param string upgName: Name of upgrade to spend hashes on. Must be an exact match
    :param string upgTarget: Object to which upgrade applies. Required for certain upgrades

    .. note:: This function is only applicable for Hacknet Servers (the upgraded version
              of a Hacknet Node).

    Spend the hashes generated by your Hacknet Servers on an upgrade. Returns a boolean value -
    true if the upgrade is successfully purchased, and false otherwise.

    The name of the upgrade must be an exact match. The :code:`upgTarget` argument is used
    for upgrades such as :code:`Reduce Minimum Security`, which applies to a specific server.
    In this case, the :code:`upgTarget` argument must be the hostname of the server.

    Example:

    .. code:: javascript

        hacknet.spendHashes("Sell for Corporation Funds");
        hacknet.spendHashes("Increase Maximum Money", "foodnstuff");

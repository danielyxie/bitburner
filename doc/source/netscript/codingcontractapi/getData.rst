    :param string filename: Filename of the contract
    :param string hostname: Hostname of the server containing the contract.
        Optional. Defaults to current server if not provided
    :returns: The specified contract's data. Different data type depending on 
        contract type.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        data = codingcontract.getData("contract-123.cct", "home");
        answer = solve(data);
        codingcontract.attempt(answer, "contract-123.cct", "home");

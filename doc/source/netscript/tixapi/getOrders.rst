==============================

.. js:function:: getOrders()

    :RAM cost: 2.5 GB

    Returns your order book for the stock market. This is an object containing information
    for all the :ref:`Limit and Stop Orders <gameplay_stock_market_order_types>`
    you have in the stock market.

    .. note:: This function isn't accessible until you have unlocked the ability to use
              Limit and Stop Orders.

    The object has the following structure::

        {
            StockSymbol1: [ // Array of orders for this stock
                {
                    shares: Order quantity
                    price: Order price
                    type: Order type
                    position: Either "L" or "S" for Long or Short position
                },
                {
                    ...
                },
                ...
            ],
            StockSymbol2: [ // Array of orders for this stock
                ...
            ],
            ...
        }

    The "Order type" property can have one of the following four values:

        * "Limit Buy Order"
        * "Limit Sell Order"
        * "Stop Buy Order"
        * "Stop Sell Order"

    **Note that the order book will only contain information for stocks that you actually
    have orders in**. For example, if you do not have orders in Nova Medical (NVMD), then the returned
    object will not have a "NVMD" property.

    Example::

        {
            ECP: [
                {
                    shares: 5,
                    price: 100,000
                    type: "Stop Buy Order",
                    position: "S",
                },
                {
                    shares: 25,
                    price: 125,000
                    type: "Limit Sell Order",
                    position: "L",
                },
            ],
            SYSC: [
                {
                    shares: 100,
                    price: 10,000
                    type: "Limit Buy Order",
                    position: "L",
                },
            ],
        }

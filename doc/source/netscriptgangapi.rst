Netscript Gang API
==================

Netscript provides the following API for interacting with the game's Gang mechanic.

The Gang API is **not** immediately available to the player and must be unlocked
later in the game

**WARNING: This page contains spoilers for the game**

The Gang API is unlocked in BitNode-2. Currently, BitNode-2 is the only location
where the Gang mechanic is accessible. This may change in the future

**Gang API functions must be accessed through the 'gang' namespace**

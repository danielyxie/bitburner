<ul class="simple">
<li>New gameplay feature that is currently in BETA: Hacking Missions. Hacking Missions is an active gameplay mechanic (its a minigame) that is meant to be used to earn faction reputation. However, since this is currently in beta, hacking missions will NOT grant reputation for the time being, since the feature likely has many bugs, balance problems, and other issues. If you have any feedback regarding the new feature, feel free to let me know</li>
<li>CHANGED THE RETURN VALUE OF getScriptIncome() WHEN RAN WITH NO ARGUMENTS. It will now return an array of two values rather than a single value. This may break your scripts, so make sure to update them!</li>

<li>Added getServerMinSecurityLevel(), getPurchasedServers(), and getTimeSinceLastAug() Netscript functions</li>
<li>Netscript scp() function can now take an array as the first argument, and will try to copy every file specified in the array (it will just call scp() normally for every element in the array). If an array is passed in, then the scp() function returns true if at least one element from the array is successfully copied</li>
<li>Added Javascript's Date module to Netscript. Since 'new' is not supported in Netscript yet, only the Date module's static methods will work (now(), UTC(), parse(), etc.).</li>

<li>Added secondary 'prestige' system - featuring Source Files and BitNodes</li>
<li>MILD SPOILERS HERE: Installing 'The Red Pill' Augmentation from Daedalus will unlock a special server called w0r1d_d43m0n. Finding and manually hacking this server through Terminal will destroy the Player's current BitNode, and allow the player to enter a new one. When destroying a BitNode, the player loses everything except the scripts on his/her home computer. The player will then gain a powerful second-tier persistent upgrade called a Source File. The player can then enter a new BitNode to start the game over. Each BitNode has different characteristics, and many will have new content/mechanics as well. Right now there are only 2 BitNodes. Each BitNode grants its own unique Source File. Restarting and destroying a BitNode you already have a Source File for will upgrade your Source File up to a maximum level of 3.</li>

<li>Both the effect of weaken() and its time to execute were halved. In other words, calling weaken() on a server only lowers its security by 0.05 (was 0.1 before) but the time to execute the function is half of what it was before. Therefore, the effective rate of weaken() should be about the same</li>
<li>Increased all Infiltration rewards by ~10%, and increased infiltration rep gains by an additional 20% (~32% total for rep gains)</li>
<li>The rate at which the security level of a facility increases during Infiltration was decreased significantly (~33%)</li>
<li>Getting treated at the Hospital is now 33% more expensive</li>
<li>Slightly increased the amount of time it takes to hack a server</li>
<li>Slightly decreased the amount of money gained when hacking a server (~6%)</li>
<li>Slightly decreased the base cost for RAM on home computer, but increased the cost multiplier. This means that upgrading RAM on the home computer should be slightly cheaper at the start, but slightly more expensive later on</li>
<li>Increased the required hacking level for many late game servers</li>
<li>The sleep() Netscript function now takes an optional 'log' argument that specifies whether or not the 'Sleeping for N milliseconds' will be logged for the script</li>
<li>Added clearLog() Netscript function</li>
<li>Deleted a few stocks. Didn't see a reason for having so many, and it just affects performance. Won't take effect until you reset by installing Augmentations</li>
<li>There was a typo with Zeus Medical's server hostname. It is now 'zeus-med' rather than 'zeud-med'</li>
<li>Added keyboard shortcuts to quickly navigate between different menus. See wiki link (<a class="reference external" href="http://bitburner.wikia.com/wiki/Shortcuts">http://bitburner.wikia.com/wiki/Shortcuts</a>)</li>
<li>Changed the Navigation Menu UI</li>

<h2>v0.25.0<a class="headerlink" href="#v0-25-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Refactored Netscript to use the open-source Acorns Parser. This re-implementation was done by [<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MrNuggelz">https://github.com/MrNuggelz</a> Github user MrNuggelz]. This has resulted in several changes in the Netscript language. Some scripts might break because of these changes. Changes listed below:</li>
<li>Arrays are now fully functional Javascript arrays. You no longer need to use the 'Array' keyword to declare them.</li>
<li>The length(), clear/clear(), insert(), and remove() functions no longer work for arrays.</li>
<li>All Javascript array methods are available (splice(), push(), pop(), join(), shift(), indexOf(), etc. See documentation)</li>
<li>Variables assigned to arrays are now passed by value rather than reference</li>
<li>Incrementing/Decrementing are now available (i++, ++i)</li>
<li>You no longer need semicolons at the end of block statements</li>
<li>Elif is no longer valid. Use 'else if' instead</li>
<li>Netscript's Hacknet Node API functions no longer log anything</li>
<li>Stock prices now update every ~6 seconds when the game is active (was 10 seconds before)</li>
<li>Added a new mechanic that affects how stock prices change</li>
<li>Script editor now has dynamic indicators for RAM Usage and Line number</li>
<li>Augmentation Rebalancing - Many late game augmentations are now slightly more expensive. Several early game augmentations had their effects slightly decreased</li>
<li>Increased the amount of rewards (both money and rep) you get from infiltration</li>
<li>Purchasing servers is now slightly more expensive</li>
<li>Calling the Netscript function getServerMoneyAvailable('home') now return's the player's money</li>
<li>Added round(n) Netscript function - Rounds a number</li>
<li>Added purchaseServer(hostname, ram) Netscript function</li>
<li>Added the TIX API. This must be purchased in the WSE. It persists through resets. Access to the TIX API allows you to write scripts that perform automated algorithmic trading. See Netscript documentation</li>
<li>Minor rebalancing in a lot of different areas</li>
<li>Changed the format of IP Addresses so that they are smaller (will consist mostly of single digit numbers now). This will reduce the size of the game's save file.</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Adjusted cost of upgrading home computer RAM. Should be a little cheaper for the first few upgrades (up to ~64GB), and then will start being more expensive than before. High RAM upgrades should now be significantly more expensive than before.</li>
<li>Slightly lowered the starting money available on most mid-game and end-game servers (servers with required hacking level greater than 200) by about 10-15%</li>
<li>Rebalanced company/company position reputation gains and requirements</li>
<li>Studying at a university now gives slightly more EXP and early jobs give slightly less EXP</li>
<li>Studying at a university is now considerably more expensive</li>
<li>Rebalanced stock market</li>
<li>Significantly increased cost multiplier for purchasing additional Hacknet Nodes</li>
<li>The rate at which facility security level increases during infiltration for each clearance level was lowered slightly for all companies</li>
<li>Updated Faction descriptions</li>
<li>Changed the way alias works. Normal aliases now only work at the start of a Terminal command (they will only replace the first word in the Terminal command). You can also create global aliases that work on any part of the command, like before. Declare global aliases by entering the optional -g flag: alias -g name=&quot;value&quot; - [<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MrNuggelz">https://github.com/MrNuggelz</a> Courtesy of Github user MrNuggelz]</li>

<li>Infiltration - Attempt to infiltrate a company and steal their classified secrets. See 'Companies' documentation for more details</li>
<li>Stock Market - Added the World Stock Exchange (WSE), a brokerage that lets you buy/sell stocks. To begin trading you must first purchase an account. A WSE account will persist even after resetting by installing Augmentations. How the stock market works should hopefully be self explanatory. There is no documentation about it currently, I will add some later. NOTE: Stock prices only change when the game is open. The Stock Market is reset when installing Augmentations, which means you will lose all your stocks</li>
<li>Decreased money gained from hacking by ~12%</li>
<li>Increased reputation required for all Augmentations by ~40%</li>
<li>Cost increase when purchasing multiple augmentations increased from 75% to 90%</li>
<li>Added basic variable runtime to Netscript operations. Basic commands run in 100ms. Any function incurs another 100ms in runtime (200ms total). Any function that starts with getServer incurs another 100ms runtime (300ms total). exec() and scp() require 400ms total.</li>

<h2>v0.22.0 - Major rebalancing, optimization, and favor system<a class="headerlink" href="#v0-22-0-major-rebalancing-optimization-and-favor-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Significantly nerfed most augmentations</li>
<li>Almost every server with a required hacking level of 200 or more now has slightly randomized server parameters. This means that after every Augmentation purchase, the required hacking level, base security level, and growth factor of these servers will all be slightly different</li>
<li>The hacking speed multiplier now increases rather than decreases. The hacking time is now divided by your hacking speed multiplier rather than multiplied. In other words, a higher hacking speed multiplier is better</li>
<li>Servers now have a minimum server security, which is approximately one third of their starting ('base') server security</li>
<li>If you do not steal any money from a server, then you gain hacking experience equal to the amount you would have gained had you failed the hack</li>
<li>The effects of grow() were increased by 50%</li>
<li>grow() and weaken() now give hacking experience based on the server's base security level, rather than a flat exp amount</li>
<li>Slightly reduced amount of exp gained from hack(), weaken(), and grow()</li>
<li>Rebalanced formulas that determine crime success</li>
<li>Reduced RAM cost for multithreading a script. The RAM multiplier for each thread was reduced from 1.02 to 1.005</li>
<li>Optimized Script objects so they take less space in the save file</li>
<li>Added getServerBaseSecurityLevel() Netscript function</li>
<li>New favor system for companies and factions. Earning reputation at a company/faction will give you favor for that entity when you reset after installing an Augmentation. This favor persists through the rest of the game. The more favor you have, the faster you will earn reputation with that faction/company</li>
<li>You can no longer donate to a faction for reputation until you have 150 favor with that faction</li>

<li><p class="first">Added dynamic arrays. See Netscript documentation</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Added ability to pass arguments into scripts. See documentation</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The implementation/function signature of functions that deal with scripts have changed. Therefore, some old scripts might not work anymore. Some of these functions include run(), exec(), isRunning(), kill(), and some others I may have forgot about. Please check the updated Netscript documentation if you run into issues.-Note that scripts are now uniquely identified by the script name and their arguments. For example, you can run a script using:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">run</span> <span class="n">foodnstuff</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">script</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and you can also run the same script with a different argument:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">run</span> <span class="n">foodnstuff</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">script</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These will be considered two different scripts. To kill the first script you must run:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">kill</span> <span class="n">foodnstuff</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">script</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and to kill the second you must run:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">kill</span> <span class="n">foodnstuff</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">script</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Similar concepts apply for Terminal Commands such as tail, and Netscript commands such as run(), exec(), kill(), isRunning(), etc.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added basic theme functionality using the 'theme' Terminal command - All credit goes to /u/0x726564646974 who implemented the awesome feature</li>
<li>Optimized Script objects, which were causing save errors when the player had too many scripts</li>
<li>Formula for determining exp gained from hacking was changed</li>
<li>Fixed bug where you could purchase Darkweb items without TOR router</li>
<li>Slightly increased cost multiplier for Home Computer RAM</li>
<li>Fixed bug where you could hack too much money from a server (and bring its money available below zero)</li>
<li>Changed tail command so that it brings up a display box with dynamic log contents. To get old functionality where the logs are printed to the Terminal, use the new 'check' command</li>
<li>As a result of the change above, you can no longer call tail/check on scripts that are not running</li>
<li>Added autocompletion for buying Programs in Darkweb</li>

<h2>v0.20.2<a class="headerlink" href="#v0-20-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed several small bugs</li>
<li>Added basic array functionality to Netscript</li>
<li>Added ability to run scripts with multiple threads. Running a script with n threads will multiply the effects of all hack(), grow(), and weaken() commands by n. However, running a script with multiple threads has drawbacks in terms of RAM usage. A script's ram usage when it is 'multithreaded' is calculated as: base cost * numThreads * (1.02 ^ numThreads). A script can be run multithreaded using the 'run [script] -t n' Terminal command or by passing in an argument to the run() and exec() Netscript commands. See documentation.</li>
<li>RAM is slightly (~10%) more expensive (affects purchasing server and upgrading RAM on home computer)</li>
<li>NeuroFlux Governor augmentation cost multiplier decreased</li>

<li>Percentage money stolen when hacking lowered to compensate for faster script speeds</li>
<li>Hacking experience granted by grow() halved</li>
<li>Weaken() is now ~11% faster, but only grants 3 base hacking exp upon completion instead of 5</li>
<li>Rebalancing of script RAM costs. Base RAM Cost for a script increased from 1GB to 1.5GB. Loops, hack(), grow() and weaken() all cost slightly less RAM than before</li>
<li>Added getServerRequiredHackingLevel(server) Netscript command.</li>
<li>Added fileExists(file, [server]) Netscript command, which is used to check if a script/program exists on a specified server</li>

<li>Hacknet Node base production rate lowered from 1.6 to 1.55 ($/second)</li>
<li>Increased monetary cost of RAM (Upgrading home computer and purchasing servers will now be more expensive)</li>
<li>NEW GROWTH MECHANICS - The rate of growth on a server now depends on a server's security level. A higher security level will result in lower growth on a server when using the grow() command. Furthermore, calling grow() on a server raises that server's security level by 0.004. For reference, if a server has a security level of 10 it will have approximately the same growth rate as before.</li>
<li>Server growth no longer happens naturally</li>
<li>Servers now have a maximum limit to their money. This limit is 50 times it's starting money</li>
<li>Hacking now grants 10% less hacking experience</li>
<li>You can now edit scripts that are running</li>

<li>Calling grow() and weaken() in a script will now work offline, at slower rates than while online (The script now keeps track of the rate at which grow() and weaken() are called when the game is open.

<li>Added exec() Netscript command, used to run scripts on other servers.</li>
<li>NEW HACKING MECHANICS: Whenever a server is hacked, its 'security level' is increased by a very small amount. The security level is denoted by a number between 1-100. A higher security level makes it harder to hack a server and also decreases the amount of money you steal from it. Two Netscript functions, weaken() and getServerSecurityLevel() level, were added. The weaken(server) function lowers a server's security level. See the Netscript documentation for more details</li>
